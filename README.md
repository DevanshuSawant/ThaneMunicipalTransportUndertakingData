# TMTU

## This Code uses the "https://tmtitsapi.locationtracker.com/api/" API used in the *WHEREISMYTMTBUS* app to extract -  
- [x] Bus Stops   
Bus Stops can be extracted directly from the waypoints API (test/TMTStopsDirect.json) and also through the routes API (test/TMTStopsThroughRoutes.json)
- [x] Bus Routes   
- [ ] Bus Locations  

## The endpoints for the API used above are available [HERE](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/2747537655c74ff8f064)
